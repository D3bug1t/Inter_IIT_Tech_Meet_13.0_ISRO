# High Resolution Elemental Mapping of Lunar Surface

## Overview
The project leverages the CLASS dataset's SOLARANG header property,which specifies the angle between the sunâ€²s position and the horizontal plane of the lunar surface from the orbiter's position. The concept of orbits arises from the observed continuous and periodic behavior of the solar angles, where it goes from a maxima to a particular minimum and back to the same maximum, marking the completion of an orbit. The critical angle (here named as back_angle) is taken as 91 degrees, above which the data is considered for background calculation for the flare files (files having SOLARANG < 90 degree) of that particular orbit. For every orbit the flare and background file names are stored in a csv file to use it ahead in calculating the initial guesses for gaussian fitting of the CLASS spectrum.

It incorporates the use of dataframe obtained from `extract_orbits` function, loads the flare and background files corresponding to each orbit and finds initial guesses (amplitude, center, sigma) of each element ('Mg', 'Al', 'Si', 'Fe', 'Ca', 'Ti', 'Cr', 'O').

Though the Galactic Cosmic-Ray (GCR) background is subtracted from the XRF data, it still needs further correction due to the scattered solar spectrum disturbing the actual spectral distribution following which the scattered solar spectrum is taken into account by fitting the background subtracted CLASS spectrum through power law and then normalizing the total background subtracted spectrum (Galactic Cosmic Ray and scattered solar spectrum components) with the power law fitted component. 

The `Spatial_Resolution.py` script performs spatial resolution mapping and visualization for the ratio of a given element to **Silicon (Si)**. It calculates grid-based averages for the specified ratio, using latitude and longitude bounding boxes, and visualizes the distribution over a lunar surface map.

## Functions Overview

### `extract_orbits`

**Purpose:**  
Extracts the orbit using the CLASS files' solar angle (SOLARANG) property from its header, segregating the flare (having solar angle < 90 degree, thus considering them as daytime files) and background (having solar angle > 91 degree, thus considering them as background) files and storing the same in a .csv file.

**Parameters:**
- `data_path` (`str`): Path to the directory where CLASS files are stored.
- `back_angle` (`int`): Value of the solar angle above which the files are grouped as background files for that particular orbit,  taken as 91.
- `year` (`int`): Year of the CLASS files taken into consideration.
- `month` (`int`): Month of that particular year files taken into consideration.
- `day` (`int`): Day of that particlaur month files taken into consideration.

**Returns:**
- Returns a dataframe where each row depicts a particular orbit inside which the first column stores the flare files and the second column stores the background files of that orbit.

**Working:**  
1. The code appends a '0' infront of the date/month in case it is less than 10 (Example: 6 -> 06).
2. It loads the file of that particular date and observes the periodic behaviour of the solar angle to mark the completion of one orbit.
3. When it reaches the last peak of that day, it checks whether the path to the next day exists or not and accordingly appends that orbit to the dataframe.

### `avg_km_per_degree_lon`

**Purpose:**
The function avg_km_per_degree_lon calculates the average distance (in kilometers) covered per degree of longitude for a specified range of latitudes on a spherical body (the Moon), given its radius.

**Parameters:**
- `lat1 (float)`: The starting latitude of the range (in degrees).

The function returns a `float`: The average distance (in kilometers) covered per degree of longitude for the given latitude range.

**Working:** 
1. `Latitude to radians`:
 Convert the latitude values from degrees to radians using np.radians.
 The cosine of the latitude is used because the longitude lines converge at the poles, making the effective distance per degree of longitude proportional to the cosine of the latitude.
2. `Average cosine value`:
 The function calculates the cosine of the latitude for 100 evenly spaced points between lat1 and lat2 using np.linspace and np.mean.
3. `Distance calculation`:
 The circumference of the spherical body at the equator is calculated as 2Ï€Ã—radius.
 This circumference is divided by 360 to get the distance covered per degree of longitude at the equator.
 The value is multiplied by the average cosine of the latitudes to account for the variation in longitude distance with latitude.
